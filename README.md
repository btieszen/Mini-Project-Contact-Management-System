Welcome to the Contact management System..  In this program you have an interactive menu that alows you to have different choices on how to manage the system. The first one is to add a contact.  It will ask for the contacts name , phone number and if not entered in the specific way will ask again. It will then ask for a valid wmail and then any other information you would like to add for the contact.  Number 2 is to edit the contact.  Here you can change the name,phone number email or addition information.
Number 3 allows yuo to delete a contact, Number 4 allows you to search for a contact by there name.  Number 5 will display all the contacts.  Number 6 will allow you to save a specific contact to a file.  Finally number 7 will exit the program. Thank you.
